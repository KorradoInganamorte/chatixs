  "The chronomorph is a crystalline artifact capable of 'editing' timelines. From the outside, it looks like a transparent polyhedron the size of a palm, inside of which you can see wave-like shimmers resembling liquid glass. Its structure is built from quantum lattices that hold tiny fragments of recorded time. When the chronomorph is activated around an object, it creates a 'temporal lens' — an area of space where time flows at a configured speed. You can accelerate the recovery of plants, slow down the corrosion of metal, or even freeze a moment as if it were permanently suspended in the air. The main risk is temporal instability: if the stabilization phase is disrupted, the artifact can 'melt' into the temporal continuum, pulling in all nearby events. Scientists from an alternative version of Earth believe that chronomorphs were created by a civilization that existed before the Big Bang, where time was not a flowing phenomenon but a material from which reality itself was constructed.";
